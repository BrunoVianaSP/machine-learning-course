# Machine Learning A-Z - Hands On with Python and Learning

## Section 1 - Introduction

### Applications of Machine Learning

**Image Recognition**  
**Game Body Recognition like Kinect**  
**Virtual Reality headset**  
**Voice Recognition**  
**Robots**  
**Advertisement delivery**  
**Recomender Systems**  
**Earth climates monitoring**  
**Neuroscience improvements**  
**Territories exploration**  

These are basic applications of Machine Learning used in our real life.  


## Installing Python and Anaconda (Mac & Windows)

**Go to:** https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python just download for your O.S and follow the instructions for installing it. It's just a very basic installation. There is no weird configuration.  

**After installation:** open the Spyder IDE go to view > toolbars > Variable explorer; Object inspector. These are the toolbars we're going to need. 


## Installing R and R Studio (Mac & Windows)

### Install R

**Go to:** https://cran.r-project.org/ download R for you O.S install it then you'll have the R language installed in your machine.  

### Install R Studio

**Go to:** https://www.rstudio.com/ select the right one for your O.S just install it and you're ready.


## Section 2 - Data Preprocessing

### Importing the libraries
Here are the libraries we're gonna need most part of the course.

**Python:** 

**import numpy as np**: includes the mathematic tools needed. [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
**import matplotlib.pyplot as plt**: for ploting some charts. [MatplotLib](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html)
**import pandas as pd**: for manage datasets. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
 





### Importing the dataset

### Missing Data

### Categorical Data

### Spliting Dataset into Training and Test sets

### Feature Scaling
